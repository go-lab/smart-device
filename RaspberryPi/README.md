Raspberry Pi-Arduino Laboratory (smart-device)
===============================================
In this repository you can find the basic files needed to built your own Raspberry Pi-Arduino laboratory using websockets.
To use this files you have to following previously the instructions into Wiki (https://github.com/go-lab/smart-device/wiki/How-to-use-Node.js-and-Socket.io-labratories-with-Raspberry-Pi-and-Arduino).

Laboratories
============
You can use the files into "robotic_arm-raspberry-pi" folder reading the README files to understand how can you use each folder. Please, read them carefully before download this repository to your Raspberry Pi or PC.
The other laboratories are in Beta version and are not available for now.

Requirements
============
To use this laboratory you have to count with:<br>
-A knowledge of server and client side on linux systems (Raspbian), managing of packages repositories and development experience.<br>
-A Robotic Arm connected to Arduino. <br>
-A Raspberry Pi Model B (is not tested the recently Model B+, yet).<br>
-An Arduino UNO R3 board.<br>
-Optional: If you want use another server to load the client side files instead of Raspberry Pi (for instance: a PC with Apache server installed to use on client side) you can do it, too.<br>

How works
=========
Read this link into Wiki: https://github.com/go-lab/smart-device/wiki/Robotic-Arm-Laboratory

Laboratories
============
On this folder you can find the laboratories developed with Raspberry Pi and Arduino UNO board.<br>
Currently you can use the Robotic Arm Laboratory downloading the files of the folder "robotic_arm-raspberry-pi".<br>
The other laboratories are in development phase so they are not available yet.<br>

Warning
=======
Please, follow the instructions of README and Wiki carefully and remember that every flavour of linux (Raspbian included) has its own characteristics.<br>

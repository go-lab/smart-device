This folder content the compilation used to the Robotic Arm Laboratory for the Raspberry Pi. 

If you do not have any problem during the installation of node.js, socket.io and serialport packages. You do not need to download this folder to your raspberry pi. Wiki: https://github.com/go-lab/smart-device/wiki/How-to-use-Node.js-and-Socket.io-labratories-with-Raspberry-Pi-and-Arduino#install-nodejs-socketsio-and-libraries-in-raspberry-pi

This folder contains the libraries needed to complement the Node.js server functions.

==============

The main libraries needed to use with this laboratory are:

-Socket.io library: Let use Websockets as communication transport protocol between client side and server side. 

-Serialport library provides the communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino by USB port.

-Xml2json library is only needed if you want to use JSON/XML services with the laboratory.

The "node" folder
=================
This folder include the compilation of Node.js to the Raspberry Pi (model, kernel and firmware) used to built this laboratory.

Warning
=======
you should have advanced knowledges the linux systems (Raspbian/Debian) to compile kernel files. These libraries will only be useful if you have problems to find, download or install these libraries.

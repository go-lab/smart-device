The Arduino IDE is an open-source Arduino environment which makes it easy to write code and upload it to the i/o board (http://arduino.cc/en/pmwiki.php?n=main/software).<br>

The arduino IDE needs a folder to look for the .ino program. Therefore, you need to download (the folder named robotic_arm and the robotic_arm.ino file). Once they are downloaded in your pc, you must use the Arduino IDE to upload the robotic_arm into Arduino UNO R3 board.<br>

Description of the file
=======================
The robotic_arm.ino is loaded to Arduino. It controls the Robotic Arm.<br>

The robotic_arm.ino translates the orders received from Raspberry Pi into physical movements of Robotic Arm.<br>

Language
========
This file is codifying on C++/C.

The Arduino IDE is an open-source Arduino environment which makes it easy to write code and upload it to the i/o board  (http://arduino.cc/en/pmwiki.php?n=main/software)

The arduino IDE needs a folder to look for the .imo program. Therefore, you need to download (the folder named robotic_arm and the robotic_arm.ino file). Once they are downloaded your pc, you must use the Arduino IDE to upload the robotic_arm into Arduino UNO R3 board.


Description of the file
=======================
The robotic_arm.ino is loaded to Arduino. It controls the Robotic Arm.

The robotic_arm.ino translates the orders received from Raspberry Pi into phisical movements of Robotic Arm.


Language
